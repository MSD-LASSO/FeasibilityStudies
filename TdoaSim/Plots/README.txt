Directory of Plots. Subdirectories are usually generated by GraphSaver.m

AbsoluteRelative Error Comparison -- plots comparing absolute and relative error estimations.
				     The absolute error uses the correct answer. The relative 
				     error guesses how far off it is.                
CNNoutputs -- outputs from a trained convolutional neural network, see the CNN folder.                                       
GroundTrackTestSensitivityPlanes -- Tests results of TDoA over a ground track.
How Hyperbolas Shift with Error -- Studies how hyperbolas shift with input error.                  
Images for Presentation -- images used in the TDoA presentation.
Issues -- pictures of some of the resolved issues experienced throughout the TDoA algorithm.                                            
MonteCarlo10Triangles -- results from MonteCarlo using symbolic solver.                            
MonteCarlo10TrianglesEdgesAdjustedHyperbolaCost -- results from MonteCarlo using distance optimizer.
MonteCarlo10TrianglesLeastSquaresTimeDifference -- results from using time difference optimizer.
MonteCarloHistograms -- examples of histograms, generated from symbolic solver.                                                           
RangeApproximation -- plots showing that a range approximator function has sufficiently low error.                            
Sensitivity10Triangles -- One-at-a-time sensivity analysis for the symbolic solver.                           
TDoA with all 3 solvers -- comparisons of the three solver methods on a myraid of errors.                          
at e5 zenith planes -- Comparison of using 50km, 400km, 1200km and 50Mm, 400Mm, 1200Mm planes.
