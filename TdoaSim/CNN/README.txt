This directory contains scripts to generate training/testing images and to train a convolutional
neural network on those images. This was part of a Machine Intelligence Term Project. The paper 
and poster for the class are included in this directory.

The results was that the convolutional neural network could not predict the direction of the 
satellite in lieu of TDoA. None of these scripts are used in LASSO, but were left here as part of the 
history of the project.
