Unit and integration tests. Run Main.m to run all tests.

This will run all test scripts. These test scripts help show functionality and status of
the algorithm. 

Under the non-functional tests folder:

NOTE: fitHyperbolaParametricTest was never completed, thus these tests will fail. 
To save the plots coming out of GroundTrackTest, uncomment GraphSaver. It is recommended you only
uncomment this when running GroundTrackTest on its own. Running it with runtests will save figures 
open from other tests as well.

NOTE: TDoA3DTest was never really implemented. There is one test that is the 3D analog of the first
TDoA2DTest.
